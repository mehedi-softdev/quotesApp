# quotesApp
API test


# What used 
The app gets quotes from https://quotable.io/quotes site through api call (test quotes). And stores it to database (as a catch)
<br>
If network is not available then it load data from local catch else from network api
<br>
The whole test app is based on MVVM architecture(which one is google recommended)
